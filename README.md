# Instrumentator

### STATUS:

*Instrumentator is in early development. Currently, the script can only generate instrumentals in four pre-specified layouts.*

*Once Instrumentator is fully developed, I will begin developing a process to upload the instrumentals to media platforms.*

### DESCRIPTION:

Instrumentator generates instrumentals from 8 bar loops.

Currently, for instrumentator to work, all it needs:

- An eight bar drum loop labeled with its Key and BPM (Ex: "Cm - 180 BPM")
- An eight bar melody loop labeled with its Key and BPM (Ex: "D# - 67 BPM")

The key and bpm of the inputted loops do not need to be the same; Instrumentator pitch and time shifts accordingly.
