# Instrumentator

### STATUS:

*Currently, the script can only generate instrumentals in six pre-specified layouts.*

### DESCRIPTION:

Instrumentator generates instrumentals and publishes them to a instrumental-selling platform.

Instrumentator can work in either Windows or Linux.

Currently, for instrumentator to work, all it needs is:

- An eight bar drum loop labeled with its Key and BPM (Ex: "Cm - 180 BPM")
- An eight bar melody loop labeled with its Key and BPM (Ex: "D# - 67 BPM")

The key and bpm of the inputted loops do not need to be the same; Instrumentator pitch and time shifts accordingly.
